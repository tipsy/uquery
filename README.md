# µQuery

#### µQuery is an experimental library for writing inline JavaScript
#### It's being developed for a webapp that demands extreme download speed due to the userbase being in countries with poor internet connectivity (we *really* want to minimize the number of requests)
#### It is probably not suitable for your project
